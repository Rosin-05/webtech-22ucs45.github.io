<h1>Basic Table Elements and Attributes</h1>
Now that you ’ ve seen how basic tables work, this section describes the elements in a little more detail,
introducing the attributes they can carry. Some of the attributes allow you to create more sophisticated
table layouts. Feel free to skim through this section fairly quickly; once you know what is possible to do
with the markup, you can always come back again and study the markup more closely in order to see
how to achieve what you want.
<ol>
<li>The < table > Element Creates a Table</li>
<li>The < table > element is the containing element for all tables. It can carry the following attributes:
All the universal attributes</li>
</ol>
<h1>Basic event attributes for scripting</h1>
The < table > element can carry the following deprecated attributes. Even though they are deprecated,
you will still see many of them in use today:<br><br>
align, bgcolor,border, cellpadding, cellspacing, dir, frame, rules, summary, width,
The align Attribute. (Deprecated)<br>
Although it is deprecated, the align attribute is still frequently used with tables. When used with the
< table > element, it indicates whether the table should be aligned to the left (the default), right , or
center of the page. (When used with cells, as you will see shortly, it aligns the content of that cell.) You
use the attribute like so:<br>
< table align=”center” ><br>
You can put a whole table inside a single cell of another table (or inside other block - level elements), and
if a table is contained within another element, the align attribute will indicate whether the table should
be aligned to the left, right, or center of that element.<br><br>
For example, here is a left - aligned table that is followed by some text:<br><br>
< table border=”1” align=”left” ><br>
< tr ><br>
< td > Row 1, Column 1 < /td ><br>
< td > Row 1, Column 2 < /td ><br>
< /tr ><br>
< tr ><br>
< td > Row 2, Column 1 < /td ><br>
< td > Row 2, Column 2 < /td ><br>
< /tr ><br>
< /table ><br>
<br>
you can try the example by yourself!!!
