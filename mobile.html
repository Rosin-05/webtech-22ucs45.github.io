<h1>Developing for Mobile Devices</h1>
Many people think that the use of the Web on mobile phones is not really relevant to them or their
company, especially if they (or those in their peer group) do not use web services on their mobile phones.
But two things are changing minds:<br><br>
<ol>
<l1>The success of high - profile devices such as the Blackberry and iPhone</li>
<li>Statistics that show how many people access web - based services on mobile phones</li>
</ol>
In 2009, the British government released statistics showing that 11 percent of UK mobile phone users
were using their mobile to browse the Internet, which (bearing in mind that more people have mobile
phones than web access) equates to over a fifth of web users accessing the Web via mobile devices.
Considering that the number of mobile phones sold in 2008 outstripped the entire user base of PCs, this
is a trend that is only likely to increase.<br><br>
Despite the growing interest in the mobile Web, it is not uncommon for people to view the Web on
mobile devices as being inferior or “ behind ” the experience they have on a desktop computer. Yet the
comparison between the experience of the Web on mobile devices and desktop computers is not quite as
straightforward as it might first seem.<br><br>
<h1>Understanding the Medium and How It Is Used</h1>
When it comes to thinking about how people access the Web on mobile phones, there are some very
important aspects to consider:<br><br>
Context: What the user is doing when using a mobile phone<br>
Relationship: How people treat their mobile phone<br>
Capabilities: The features and capabilities of mobile phones compared with desktop computers
Context: What Is the Mobile User Doing?<br>
Mobile devices are being used on the move, often in a hurry, and sometimes one - handed. The result is
that when mobile phones are used to access the Web, they are often used to achieve very different things
than the same user might want to achieve in front of a desktop computer.<br><br>
While people sit for hours in front of a desktop computer surfing the Web, when users are out and about,
they are far less likely to be just surfing — rather they are more likely to want to do something specific
(whether this is checking the local weather forecast, latest news headlines and sports results, or finding
out the opening hours of a nearby shop).<br><br>
It is important here to note that a laptop, even though it is portable, is often used in the same manner as
a desktop, even if the user is in a coffee shop, a car park, or at an airport.<br><br>
When you start to think about your site appearing on a mobile device, it is wise to go back to the
beginning of this chapter and create a new set of actors or personae that reflects the typical visitors to
your site via a mobile phone.<br><br>
At the same time, you should be creating a new set of tasks that they might want to achieve, because the
mobile user will often want to achieve different things than the desktop user would. For example, mobile
users accessing a supermarket web site are more likely to look for the nearest store and its hours than
they are to do their weekly grocery shopping on their phones.<br><br>
Even if users want the same information that they might request when at a desktop computer (for
example to check the latest sports results or weather forecast in their area), you should always consider
whether they may benefit from the information being displayed in a very different way.
Relationship: How Do Users Treat Their Mobile Phones?<br><br>
It is also worth comparing the relationship that people have with their mobile phones compared with
desktop computers. It is far more common for people to have their own mobile phones whereas desktop
computers are often shared between members of a family, or used at work and schools. This means that
people have a more personal relationship with their mobile phones. It also means that it is possible to
more accurately uniquely identify users and personalize services to them.
These devices are also usually carried around 24 hours a day, no matter where the owner is (they may be
turned on silent, but rarely turned off).<br><br>
<h1>Do Not Develop a Mobile Site</h1>
The cheapest and least time-intensive strategy for mobile development is simply to do nothing. Many
mobile phones are adept at giving users access to the content on the site. Some larger touch-screen
phones (such as the iPhone) are capable of cleverly resizing a web page to fit on the screen, then allow
users to zoom into parts of the page. Other phones may change the way in which the page is presented
in order to make it available on the size of screen they have (often overriding font sizes and image sizes).
The obvious drawback with this approach is that your content is not addressing the aims that visitors to
a mobile site might have.
