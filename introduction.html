<h1>Introducing HTML and XHTML:-</h1>
 Even if you have never seen any HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) code, you may be familiar with
the fact that it is used to create most web pages. There have been several versions of HTML since the
Web began, and the development of the language is overseen by an organization called the W3C (World
Wide Web Consortium).
 The last major version of HTML was HTML 4.01 in December 1999. In January 2000, some stricter rules
were added to HTML 4.01, creating what is known as XHTML (Extensible Hypertext Markup
Language), and it is this version of the language that we will be focusing on throughout this book.
Generally, you will see the term XHTML used in the rest of this book. Unless otherwise mentioned, the
same rules apply to HTML.
Let ’ s have a look at a very simple web page,<br><br>
< html ><br>
 < head ><br>
 < title > Popular Websites: Google < /title ><br>
 < /head ><br>
 < body ><br>
 < h1 > About Google < /h1 ><br>
 < p > Google is best known for its search engine, although
 Google now offers a number of other services. < /p ><br>
 < p > Google’s mission is to organize the world’s
 information and make it universally accessible and
 useful. < /p ><br>
 < p > Its founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin started
 Google at Stanford University. < /p ><br>
 < /body ><br>
 < /html ><br>
<h4>this will produce the proper output as:-</h4>
<html>
 <head>
 <title> Popular Websites: Google </title>

 <h1> About Google </h1>

<h1>Tags and Elements:-</h1>
 If you look at the first and last lines of the code for the last example, you will see pairs of angle brackets
containing the letters “ html ” Starting on the first line, the first angled bracket looks like a less - than sign,
then there are the letters “ html ,” followed by a second angled bracket, which looks like a greater - than
sign. The two brackets and all of the characters between them are known as a tag .
 In this example, there are lots of tags and they are all in pairs; there are opening tags and closing tags . The
closing tag is always slightly different from the opening tag in that it has a forward slash after the first
angled bracket: < /html > .
 A pair of tags and the content these include are known as an element .
