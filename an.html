<h1>Creating Links with the < a > Element</h1>
You have already seen examples of using the < a > element to create links. For the rest of the chapter
we ’ ll look more closely at the < a > element, and you ’ ll see how it can be used to link to a specific
part of a page.
As with all journeys, links have a starting point known as the source , and a finishing point known as the
destination ; in XHTML both points are called anchors . Each link that you see on a page that you can click
is a source anchor , created using the < a > element. You can also use the < a > element to create markers in
parts of your pages that allow you to link directly to that part of the page. These markers are called
destination anchors .<br><br>
For example, when you click the words Wrox Web site (which you can see are inside the < a > element)
the link takes you to http://www.wrox.com/ :<br><br>
Why not visit the < a href=”http://www.wrox.com/” > Wrox Web site < /a ></font>
