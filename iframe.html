<h1>Inline or Floating Frames with < iframe ></h1>
There is another kind of frame known as an iframe (sometimes referred to as an inline frame or floating
frame ), which can appear anywhere within a standard XHTML page; it does not need to appear either in
a < frameset > element or even in a document that uses the frameset document type declaration.
An iframe acts like a window cut into an XHTML page through which you can see another web page. You
can specify the URL of the page to appear in the window, the width and height of the window, and
whether or not it should have borders. Any text that surrounds the frame would flow around it in the same
way text can flow around an image. You create an iframe with the < iframe > element, and you specify the
URL of the page to appear in the iframe using the src attribute (just as you would with an image).
The following is a simple example of a floating frame. If you look at the src attribute you can tell that
the iframe embeds a Google map into the page, while the width and height attributes indicate the size
of the iframe:<br>
< html ><br>
< head ><br>
< title >iframe tag< /title ><br>
< /head ><br>
< body ><br>
< h1 >iframe tag< /h1 ><br>
< iframe src="https://www.wikipedia.org/" width="350" height="600"
title="display wikipedia home page" ><br>
< /iframe ><br>
< iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5oH9Nr3bKfw" title="YouTube video"
width="900" height="600" ><br>
< /iframe ><br>
< /iframe ><br>
< /body ><br>
< /html ><br><br>
this will display the output as:-<br><br>
<html>
<head>
<title>iframe tag</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>iframe tag</h1>
<iframe src="https://www.wikipedia.org/" width="350" height="600"
title="display wikipedia home page">
</iframe>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5oH9Nr3bKfw" title="YouTube video"
width="900" height="600">
</iframe>
</iframe>
</body>
</html>

When creating an iframe, you should use both an opening < iframe > tag and a closing < /iframe > (it
should not be an empty element). Anything between these is shown only to those whose browsers do
not support iframes (in this example you can see that a link to the map has been offered to users that do
not see the iframe). If your iframe contained information that you would want a search engine to index,
you could include the text that you want it to index in here.<br>
