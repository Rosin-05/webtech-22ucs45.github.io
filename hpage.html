<h1>Designing Pages</h1>
By now, you should know how many pages you have and the main elements that you need to fit on each
page, and you might have decided whether you are going to use a fixed - width layout or a liquid layout.
Now it ’ s time to work out how the content is going to fit onto the page. All of this should happen before
you start building your page.<br><br>
<i>It is important to distinguish between the use of the word elements in terms of designing pages (where it
means items on the page such as navigation, branding, articles/products, and so on) and the more technical
use of the word (because an element can also mean a pair of tags and their content, such as a
< b > bold < /b > element). Most of this section will refer to elements in terms of designing pages.

<h1>Composition and Grids</h1>
Composition in any visual art (such as design, painting, or photography) is the placement or arrangement
of visual elements — it is how they are organized on a page. In order to arrange the various items that
need to appear on a web page, many designers use a grid (a set of lines, which are sometimes shaded in)
and arrange the items that need to appear on a page according to the grid.<br><br>
<h1>Sketching the Placement of Elements</h1>
You have looked at the grids designers use when creating layouts, so now it is time to start getting a feel
for how the elements will be arranged on the grids.
At this point, you should just be using text, lines, and shading to sketch out where each element (such as
the logo, primary navigation, headings and main bodies of text) sits on the page and how much space it
gets. You should not be thinking yet about colors, fonts, backgrounds, images, or other design issues;
rather, you should be focusing on the placement of information and creating a visual hierarchy to indicate
the most important parts on each page.
<h1>Grouping Elements</h1>
For most people, the more disconnected bits of information that are visible on a page at the same time,
the harder the page is to understand. There are, however, several techniques you can use to group
elements together and make it easier for people to understand pages. Grouping or chunking items
together helps reduce the number of elements that the user sees on the page.
<h1>How Visitors Look at a Page</h1>
It is important to acknowledge that, no matter how much you would like your visitors to read every
page on your site, and no matter how well written it is, they will not. Visitors scan web pages to find out
whether that page is relevant to them.
During the initial scan of the page, when users determine if it is relevant to them, they will also select
parts of the page that they will focus on. They are likely to give most attention to these areas rather than
looking around for other information that might be relevant to them.
Homepages
First impressions do count, so your front page is very important. Unless you are working on a site for a
company or subject that is a household name, it ’ s important that a visitor be able to ascertain the main
purpose of your site easily from the front page. Therefore, it is a good idea to feature a one - line
description of the site prominently on the homepage (using no more than ten words — three to five is
even better).
You then need to emphasize the tasks that users are most likely to want to come to the site to do — in
order to help the most people find the information they came to see as quickly as possible.
<br><br>
<b>It is crucial to remember that your front page should not solely cover what a company
’ s marketing department wants it to cover that week or month. It ’ s not just some
advertising billboard they can use as they fancy — it must address the needs of the
majority of visitors to the site. For example, the marketing department may want to
push a new product, whereas most customers visiting the site want to find out about
an older, more established one. If those users cannot find the information they came
to the site looking for, the marketing department will not have as large an audience
for the things they want to push. Balancing what the users want with what the company
wants is extremely important — and users should not suffer.</b>
