<h1>Creating Links Between Frames</h1>
One of the most popular uses of frames is to place navigation bars in one frame and then load the pages
with the content into a separate frame. This is particularly helpful in three situations:
<ol>
<li>When your main document is very long and the navigation bar provides shortcuts to parts of
the main document (acting like a table of contents that is always in view).</li>
<li>When your navigation bar contains files that take a while to load (such as thumbnails of
photographs in a gallery). By using frames, the user does not need to reload the navigation bar
each time he or she views a new page.</li>
<li>When you do not want to reload the whole page.</li>
</ol><br>
As you have already seen, each < frame > element can carry the name attribute to give each frame a name.
This name is used in the links to indicate which frame the new page should load into. Consider this very
simple example:<br><br>
< frameset cols=”200, *” ><br>
< frame src=”frames/linksNav.html” / ><br>
< frame src=”frames/linksMain.html” name=”main_page” / ><br>
< /frameset ><br><br>
In order to specify that links should open up in the right - hand frame, the second < frame > element
(which creates the right-hand frame) carries a name attribute whose value is main_page . The links in the
navigation carry the target attribute whose value is set to main_page to indicate that the links should
open in the < frame > element whose name attribute has a value of main_page . Here are the links in the
linksNav.html file:<br><br>
< a href=”http://www.wrox.com” target=”main_page” > Wrox Press < /a > <br> < br / >
< a href=”http://www.google.com” target=”main_page” > Google < /a > <br> < br / >
< a href=”http://www.microsoft.com” target=”main_page” > Microsoft < /a > <br> < br / >
< a href=”http://news.bbc.co.uk/” target=”main_page” > BBC News < /a > <br> < br / >
