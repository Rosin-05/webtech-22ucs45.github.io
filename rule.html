<h1>Where You Can Add CSS Rules</h1>
The example that you saw at the beginning of the chapter placed the CSS rules in a separate file known
as an external style sheet . CSS rules can also appear in two places inside the XHTML document:
<ol>
<li>Inside a < style > element, which sits inside the < head > element of a document</li>
<li>As a value of a style attribute on any element that can carry the style attribute</li>
<li>as an internal style sheet</li>
<li>as an external style sheet</li>
</ol><br>
When the style sheet rules are held inside a < style > element in the head of the document, they are
referred to as an internal style sheet.<br><br>
< head ><br>
< title > Internal Style sheet < /title ><br>
< style type=”text/css” ><br>
body {<br>
color:#000000;<br>
background-color:#ffffff;<br>
font-family:arial, verdana, sans-serif; }<br>
h1 {font-size:18pt;}<br>
p {font-size:12pt;}<br>
< /style ><br>
< /head ><br><br>
When style attributes are used on XHTML elements, they are known as inline style rules . For example:<br><br>
< td style=”font-family:courier; padding:5px; border-style:solid;
border-width:1px; border-color:#000000;” ><br><br>
<h1>Advantages of External CSS Style Sheets</h1>

If two or more documents are going to use a style sheet, you should use an external style sheet. There are
several reasons for this, including:
<ol>
<li>It saves you repeating the same style rules in each page.</li>
<li>You can change the appearance of several pages by altering just the style sheet rather than each
individual page. This means it is easier to update your site if you want to, for example, change
the style of font used in all headings or alter the color of all links.</li>
<li>Once a visitor to your site has downloaded the CSS style with the first page of your site that
uses it, subsequent pages will be quicker to load (because the browser retains a copy of the CSS
style sheet and the rules do not have to be downloaded for every page). This also puts less strain
on the server (the computer that sends the web pages to the people viewing the site) because the
pages it sends out are smaller.</li>
<li>The style sheet can act as a style template to help different authors achieve the same style of
document without learning all of the individual style settings.</li>
<li>Because the web pages do not contain the style rules, different style sheets can be attached to the
same document. So you can use the same XHTML document with one style sheet when the
viewer is on a desktop computer, another style sheet when the user has a handheld device,
another style sheet when the page is being printed, another style sheet when the page is being
viewed on a TV, and so on. You can reuse the same document with different style sheets for
different visitors ’ needs.</li>
<li>A style sheet can import and use styles from other style sheets, allowing for modular
development and good reuse. (For example, I have a style sheet that I import into other style
sheets whenever I want to include examples of programming code in a web page — I do not need
to write the style rules again and again.)</li>
<li>If you remove the style sheet, you can make the site more accessible for those with visual
impairments, because you are no longer controlling the fonts and color schemes.</li>
