<h1>Understanding the Site ’ s Audience</h1>
Whether you are going to create a web site for yourself or are hoping to create sites for clients, in order
for the design to be effective you need to be able to answer four questions about the audience for your
site: 
<br>
<ol>
<li>who, why, what, and how often?</li>
<li>Who? Who will visit the site?</li>
<li>Why? Why have they come to your site? They probably want to achieve something .</li>
<li>What? What sort of information do you think they would expect to find in order to satisfy their
reason for coming to the site?</li>
<li>How often? How often can you realistically expect them to visit?</li>
</ol>
The following sections will help you find out how to answer these questions, but first it is worth noting
here that these questions are about your visitors and what they want from your site rather than what you
(or your client) want from visitors.
<h1>Who Will Visit the Site?</h1>
Throughout the design process, you must keep one thing in mind: You need to design the page for the
target audience of the site — not just yourself or the site owner.<br><br>
If you ask a new client whom they are hoping to attract to their site, it is not uncommon for the answer
to be along the lines of “ the entire world. ” While it may be easier for people of all ages in all countries to
visit a web site than it is for individuals to pop into a store or visit an exhibition, there are very few sites
that will appeal to everyone.<br><br>
Some of the following questions will help you define your target audience (some may be more relevant
to your site than others):
<ol>
<li>What is the age range of your target audience?</li>
<li>Will your site appeal more to men or women?</li>
<li>Which country do your visitors live in?</li>
<li>Do they live in an urban area or rural area?</li>
<li>What is the income level of the visitors?</li>
<li>What level of education do they have?</li>
<li>What is their marital or family status?</li>
<li>What is their occupation?</li>
<li>How many hours do they work per week?</li>
<li>How often do they use the Web?</li>
</ol>
If your site is aimed at a business:
<ol>
<li>What is the size of the company?</li>
<li>What is the size of the department?</li>
<li>What is the position on individuals in the company using the site?</li>
<li>Will these individuals be using the item or information themselves?</li>
<li>How large is the budget they control?</li>
</ol>
Once you have a better idea of who is coming to your site, you can invent five fictional visitors,
sometimes referred to as actors or personae , representing the range of your target audience. For example,
if you think your audience is composed of well - educated men and women between the ages of 20 and

<h1>Why Have They Visited Your Site?</h1>
While some people may happen across your site because they ’ re browsing and see a link that they think
is interesting, the majority of visitors arrive at your site for a reason. Your design should be influenced
by the goals of users, and therefore you should try and list all the goals that people might have in mind
when visiting the site.<br><br>
It isn ’ t possible to list every reason why people visit your site, but you are trying to get to the salient
points, such as the following:
<ol>
<li>A traveler wants to look at a hotel web site because he is creating a shortlist of hotels he may
want to stay at in a city.</li>
<li>A shopper wants to know the opening hours of her local store.</li>
<li>A hobby - guitarist wants to look at a guitar web site to keep up to date with the latest guitars.</li>
<li>An investor wants to see if a scientific research company has sold previous research, and
therefore shows promise as an investment.</li>
<li>A picture editor wants to look at a photographer ’ s site to see work examples before deciding
whether or not to hire the photographer.</li>
</ol>
To help determine why people are coming to your site, you should examine two basic categories of
questions. The first category attempts to discover the underlying motivations of why visitors visit your
site. The second category examines the specific goals of your visitors. In order to identify the underlying
motivation for a visitor to come to your site you can ask questions such as:
<li>Is it to be entertained or to achieve a specific goal?</li>
<li>Is the goal for personal or professional reasons?</li>
</ol>
<h1>Would they see this as being essential or a luxury?</h1>
To find out the specific goals of visitors you can ask questions such as:
<ol>
<li>Do they want general information/research (such as background on a topic/a company), or are
they after something specific (such as a particular fact or information on a product)?</li>
<li>Are they looking looking for the latest news or updates on a particular topic?</li>
<li>Do they want to discover information about a specific product/service to help them decide
whether to buy it?</li>
Do they want to buy a product or service they are already familiar with?</li>
<li>Do they want information on ways to contact you? If so, can they visit you in person (which
might require you to publish opening hours and a map of locations).</li>
</ol>
<h1>What Does a Visitor Need to Achieve a Goal?</h1>
Now that you have a list of reasons why people might be coming to your site, you need to work out
what you need to offer in order to help them achieve their goal quickly and effectively. You should then
prioritize the information from most important need - to - know through to things you would also like
them to know, even if these are not essential to their goals.<br><br>
The following questions may help you work out what information they need:
<ol>
<li>Will they be familiar with your brand/subject area or do you need to introduce yourself?</li>
<li>Will people be familiar with the product or service you are promoting, or do they need
background information on it?</li>
</ol>
<h1>What are the most important features of what you are offering?</h1>
What is special about your product or service that differentiates it from the rival?
Consider for a moment when visitors are comparing your product or service with a rival; you will want
to give them the key facts that they will be comparing against quickly and easily (otherwise you may not
make the shortlist). Then you can highlight what distinguishes you from the competition, along with
other background facts.<br><br>
For example, if a traveler is considering whether to shortlist a hotel as a possible place to stay, this person
may want to know what the hotel looks like, price, location, availability for the dates sought, and a
phone number (since some people want to deal directly and not put a credit card number on the Web). If
all this information isn ’ t found, the prospective traveler is less likely to shortlist you. Once you have
provided this information, you might like to add things that distinguish you from others, such as
facilities at the hotel and what to do in the area.<br><br>
You should aim to drill down as far as possible with your answers; for example, what information
are you going to include about a product or service? A product will not only have a title, it could have a
photo (or multiple photographs), description, dimensions, information about how and where it is made,
typical uses for it, and so on. A service might require descriptions of the work involved, how long it
takes to complete, what is required so the service can be performed, who will be performing the
service, how they are qualified to perform the service, testimonials from people who have paid for
this service, pictures of work done.<br><br>
There are some kinds of goals that will require a lot less information. For example, someone who wants
to find out the opening hours of your store will just want to know what time you open and close each
day, and they do not want to search through products and offers to know if they can get there before
you close.<br><br>
The results of this task will vary hugely from site to site, but the process should always involve
brainstorming everything your visitors will need to know, followed by a rationalized ordering and
prioritization of this information.
<h1>How Often Will People Want to Visit?</h1>
The last important question about your audience is how often they are likely to come back.
There is a very simple reason for asking this: Some sites should change more often than others. If your
site is about something that people do not need to keep coming back for, why spend a lot of time and
money regularly adding new content to the site? For example, if you provide a service that people rarely
use (from wedding services to double glazing), I would hope that the same person would not need to
keep coming back to your site.<br><br>
Conversely, if visitors have the potential to regularly return to the site, you will need to consider
updating the content regularly so that they want to keep coming back.
<h1>Things You Want the Site to Do</h1>
By now you should have an idea of who is coming to your site, why they are coming, what they need in
order to satisfy their reason for visiting, and when they might come back. This will probably be quite a
long list already, but there is one more thing you need to add to it: information that the site owner wants
on the site, but which might not be part of the list already.<br><br>
This may include things that users could find useful when they arrive on the site (even though they may
not have come for this reason), such as the ability to sign up for e - mail updates, subscribe to an RSS feed,
search the site, enter a competition, or find out about your new upcoming product. It may also include
information that is not really for the user (such as advertising).<br><br>
Finally, if your list does not yet include such things, don ’ t forget that you will want to include your logo
or branding to most pages. You should also remember some boring yet necessary features such as a
copyright notice, terms and conditions, and a privacy policy (the latter is important if you collect
information about users or use a technology known as cookies for storing information on the user ’ s
computer).
<h1>Prioritizing Information</h1>
Now that you have a list of what your visitors want to achieve and what the site owner wants to achieve,
you should start to prioritize that information. You have your fictional friends to help you work out
which tasks are most important. If one of them has not already asked about a piece of information, or it
will not help this person achieve a goal, it may be lower priority.
