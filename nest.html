<h1>Nested Tables</h1>
As mentioned earlier in the chapter, you can include markup inside a table cell, as long as the whole
element is contained within that cell. This means you can even place another entire table inside a table
cell, creating what ’ s called a nested table . Figure 4 - 15 shows you an example of a table that shows a
schedule for a weekend of activities.<br><br>
In the bottom - right cell of this table is a second table that divides up the attendees into two groups. :
<br><br>
< table ><br>
< tr ><br>
< th > < /th ><br>
< th > Morning < /th ><br>
< th > Afternoon < /th ><br>
< /tr ><br>
< tr ><br>
< th > Saturday < /th ><br>
< td > Cycling < /td ><br>
< td > Fishing < /td ><br>
< /tr ><br>
< tr ><br>
< th > Sunday < /th ><br>
< td > Rowing < /td ><br>
< td ><br>
< table ><br>
< tr ><br>
< th > Group 1 < /th ><br>
< th > Group 2 < /th ><br>
< /tr ><br>
< tr ><br>
< td > Water ski-ing < /td ><br>
< td > Wake boarding < /td ><br>
< /tr ><br>
< /table ><br>
< /td ><br>
< /tr ><br>
< /table ><br><br>
Now that you ’ ve seen how to create a nested table, it is worth noting that they should be used very
sparingly, because they are quite hard for those who rely upon screen readers to follow. You are about to
see this in the next section.<br><br>
