<h1>Grouping Elements with < div > and < span ></h1>
The < div > and < span > elements allow you to group several elements to create sections or subsections of
a page. On their own, they will not affect the appearance of a page, but they are commonly used with
CSS to allow you to attach a style to a section of a page (as you will see in Chapter 7). For example, you
might want to put all the footnotes on a page within a < div > element to indicate that all the elements
within that < div > element relate to the footnotes. You might then attach a style to this < div > element so
that the footnotes appear using a special set of style rules.<br><br>
The < div > element is used to group block - level elements:<br>
< div class=”footnotes” ><br>
< h2 > Footnotes < /h2 ><br>
< p > <b>1</b> The World Wide Web was invented by Tim Berners-Lee < /p ><br>
< p > <b>2</b> The W3C is the World Wide Web Consortium which maintains many
Web standards < /p ><br>
< /div ><br>
It is considered good practice to use a class attribute whose value describes the contents of this group
of elements when using a < div > . As you can see here, the value footnotes helps describe the contents
of the < div > .
The < span > element, on the other hand, can be used to group inline elements only. So, if you had a part
of a sentence or paragraph you wanted to group, you could use the < span > element. Here you can see
that I have added a < span > element to indicate which content refers to an inventor. It contains both a
bold element and some text:<br><br>
< div class=”footnotes” ><br>
< h2 > Footnotes < /h2 ><br>
< p > < span class=”inventor” > < b > 1 < /b > The World Wide Web was invented by Tim
Berners-Lee < /span > < /p ><br>
< p > < b > 2 < /b > The W3C is the World Wide Web Consortium which maintains many Web
standards < /p ><br>
< /div ><br>
<br>
<br>
you can try the examples by yourself!
