<h1>Adding Images Using the < img > Element</h1>
Images are added to a site using the < img > element, which has to carry at least two attributes: the
src attribute, indicating the source of the image, and an alt attribute, which provides a
description of the image.<br><br>
For example, the following line would add the image called logo.gif into the page 
 You can find this code at ch03_eg01.html .<br><br>
< img src=”logo.gif” alt=”Wrox logo” / >
In addition to carrying all the universal attributes and the UI event attributes (which you met in
Chapter 1), the < img > element can carry the following attributes:<br><br>
src, alt, align, border, height, width, hspace, vspace, ismap, usemap, longdesc, name.<br><br>
<h1>The src Attribute</h1>
The src attribute tells the browser where to find the image. The value is a URL and, just like the links
you met in the last chapter, the URL can be an absolute URL or a relative URL.
< img src=”logo.gif” / >
<h1>The alt Attribute</h1>
The alt attribute must appear on every < img > element and its value should be a text description of
the image.<br><br>
< img src=”logo.gif” alt=”Wrox logo” / ><br>
Often referred to as alt text , it is important that the value of this attribute really describe the
image because:<br>
<ol>
<li>If the browser cannot display the image, this text alternative will be shown instead.
Web users with visual impairments often use software called a screen reader to read a page to
them, in which case the alt text describes the image they cannot see.</li>
<li>While search engines are very clever, they cannot yet describe or index the contents of an image;
therefore, providing a text alternative helps search engines index your pages and helps visitors
find your site.</li>
<li>Sometimes images do not convey any information, and are only used to enhance the layout of the
page. (For example, you might have an image that is just a decorative element but does not add any
information to the page.)</li><br>
In such a case, the alt attribute should still be used but given no value,
as follows:<br><br>
< img src=”stripy_page_divider.gif” alt=”” / ><br><br>
<h1>Client - Side Image Maps</h1>
Client - side image maps use XHTML code to tell the browser how the image will be divided up; then the
browser can tell what part of the image someone clicks on and can send the user to the appropriate link.
There are two methods to create a client - side image map:<br><br>
<ol>
<li>Using the < map > and < area > elements inside an < img > element</li>
<li>Using the < map > element inside the < object > element</li>
look at the following example:-<br><br>
< h1 >image tag and mapping< /h1 ><br>
< img src="computer.jpg" alt="computer" title="computer"/ >
< map name="comp" >
< area shape="rect" coords="351,249,164,113" href="two.html" title="click this link to go to the website called two" >
< area shape="circle"coords="98,111,24" href="www.youtube.com" title="circle" ><br>
< /area ><br>
< /map ><br><br>
this will show the output as:-<br>
<html>
<body>
<h1>image tag</h1>
<img src="computer.jpg" alt="computer" title="computer" usemap="#comp"/>
<map name="comp">
<area shape="rect" coords="351,249,164,113" href="two.html" title="click this link to go to the website called two">
<area shape="circle"coords="98,111,24" href="www.youtube.com" title="circle">
</area>
