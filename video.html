<h1>Adding Videos to Your Site</h1>
One of the easiest ways to feature video on your site is to upload your video to a site such as YouTube,
and then embed the YouTube player in your page using the code YouTube provides. However, you
might decide that you don ’ t want to have your video on YouTube or you might not want a YouTube -
branded player on your site, so let ’ s look at some alternatives.
When you want to play a video on the web there are two things you need to consider:
File format :
<ol>
 <li>You need to choose the format of the video, and there are lots of different formats to
choose from, including AVI, Flash Video, MPEG, QuickTime, and Windows Media. Which
format you choose can influence the size of the file that users have to download and the quality
of the picture they get to watch (because the formats use different compression techniques to
create smaller files).</li>
<li>Plug - in needed to play that type of file : Different formats require different plug - ins to play the
movie. Some plug - ins are more popular than others (and are installed on a greater percentage of
computers). Examples include Flash Player, QuickTime Player, RealPlayer, and Windows
Media Player.</li>
</ol>
types of videos:-<br><br>
<ol>
<li>FLV or Flash video is by far the most popular format for showing videos on the Web, largely
because the Flash Player plug - in is installed on more computers than any of the other plug - ins
needed to show video. People familiar with the Flash authoring environment can easily create
their own video players (which are in turn shown within the Flash Player plug - in), allowing
them to control the look and feel of the player. The format also compresses well for use on
the Web.</li>
<li>MPEG is a format that takes its name from the group who developed it, the Motion Picture
Experts Group. Most computers will have a player capable of playing MPEG movies because
they can be played in Windows Media Player or QuickTime Player. The drawback of the MPEG
format is that, even though it can be compressed in many ways, files often end up much larger
than FLV formats (up to twice the size).</li>
<li>WMV or Windows Media Video is part of the Microsoft Windows Media suite, and requires
Windows Media to play it — which comes with new PCs but requires users on other platforms
to download a plug - in.</li>
<li>MOV files are based on QuickTime which was initially developed for Mac. It can be played on
most other operating systems but again requires users to download a plug - in.</li>
<li>MP4 makes very small file sizes, but users need to install QuickTime to view it.
AVI (audio/video interleaved) was originally developed as a rival to QuickTime for Windows.
It is known as a container format because it contains a video compressed with another codec.
This means that your computer may play some AVI files, and not others.</li>
</ol>
RealVideo was one of the first formats used for showing video online. It requires a plug - in
called RealPlayer to be installed on the computer. It is free but can be tricky to install. It is
rapidly falling in popularity and is generally being replaced by FLV.
