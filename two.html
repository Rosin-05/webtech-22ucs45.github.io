<h1>the big bang</h1>

<p>The Big Bang event is a physical theory that describes how the universe
 expanded from an initial state of high density and temperature.[1] Various
 cosmological models of the Big Bang explain the evolution of the observable
 universe from the earliest known periods through its subsequent large-scale
 form.</p><br><hr width="100%">
<p>These models offer a comprehensive explanation for a broad 
range of observed phenomena, including the abundance of light elements, the
 cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation, and large-scale structure. The
 overall uniformity of the Universe, known as the flatness problem, is explained
 through cosmic inflation: a sudden and very rapid expansion of space during the
 earliest moments. However, physics currently lacks a widely accepted theory of 
quantum gravity that can successfully model the earliest conditions of the Big
 Bang.</p></div>
