<h1>Lists</h1>
There are many reasons you might want to add a list to your pages, from putting your five favorite
albums on your homepage to including a numbered set of instructions for visitors to follow (like the
steps you follow in the Try It Out examples in this page).
You can create three types of lists in XHTML:
<ul>
<li>Unordered lists , which are like lists of bullet points</li>
<li>Ordered lists , which use a sequence of numbers or letters instead of bullet points</li>
<li>Definition lists , which allow you to specify a term and its definition</li>
</ul>
<h1>Using the < ul > Element to Create Unordered Lists</h1>
If you want to make a list of bullet points, you write the list within the < ul > element (which stands for
unordered list). Each bullet point or line you want to write should then be contained between opening
< li > tags and closing < /li > tags (the li stands for list item ).
You should always close the < li > element. Even though you might see some HTML pages that leave off
the closing tag, this is a bad habit you should avoid.
<h1>Ordered Lists</h1>
Sometimes, you want your lists to be ordered. In an ordered list, rather than prefixing each point with a
bullet point, you can use either numbers (1, 2, 3), letters (A, B, C), or Roman numerals (i, ii, iii) to prefix
the list item.
An ordered list is contained inside the < ol > element. Each item in the list should then be nested inside
the < ol > element and contained between opening < li > and closing < /li > tags
<h1>Definition Lists</h1>
The definition list is a special kind of list for providing terms followed by a short text definition or
description for them. Definition lists are contained inside the < dl > element. The < dl > element then
contains alternating < dt > and < dd > elements. The content of the < dt > element is the term you will be
defining. The < dd > element contains the definition of the previous < dt > element. For example, here is a
definition list that describes the different types of lists in XHTML ( ch01_eg19.html ):
< dl >
< dt > Unordered List < /dt >
< dd > A list of bullet points. < /dd >
< dt > Ordered List < /dt >
< dd > An ordered list of points, such as a numbered set of steps. < /dd >
< dt > Definition List < /dt >
< dd > A list of terms and definitions. < /dd >
< /dl >
let's look at the following example:-<br>
< html ><br>
< body ><br>
< h1 >list tag< /h1 ><br>
< h4 >different types of robot< /h4 ><br>
< ol ><br>
< li >industrial robot< /li ><br>
< li >cobot< /li ><br>
< li >humanoid robot< /li ><br>
< li >autonomous robot< /li ><br>
< /ol ><br>
< hr color="purple" width="100%" ><br>
< /body ><br>
< /html ><br>
will display output as:-
<html>
<body>
<h1>list tag</h1>
<h4>different types of robot</h4>
<ol>
<li>industrial robot</li>
<li>cobot</li>
<li>humanoid robot</li>
<li>autonomous robot</li>
</ol>
<hr color="purple" width="100%">
</body>
</html><br>
you can try other list by yourself!
