<h1>Understanding Block and Inline Elements</h1>
Now that you have seen many of the elements that can be used to mark up text, it is important to make
an observation about all the elements that live inside the < body > element, because each one can fall into
one of two categories:
Block - level elements
Inline elements
This is quite a conceptual distinction, but it will have important ramifications for other features of
XHTML.
Block - level elements appear on the screen as if they have a carriage return or line break before and after
them. For example, the < p > , < h1 > , < h2 > , < h3 > , < h4 > , < h5 > , < h6 > , < ul > , < ol > , < dl > , < pre > , < hr / > ,
< blockquote > , and < address > elements are all block - level elements. They all start on their own new
lines, and anything that follows them appears on its own new line, too.
Inline elements, on the other hand, can appear within sentences and do not have to appear on new lines
of their own. The < b > , < i > , < u > , < em > , < strong > , < sup > , < sub > , < big > , < small > , < ins > , < del > ,
< code > , < cite > , < dfn > , < kbd > , and < var > elements are all inline elements.
For example, look at the following heading and paragraph; both of these elements start on new lines and
anything that follows them goes on a new line, too. Meanwhile, the inline elements in the paragraph are
not placed on their own new lines.<br><br>
here is an simple example:-<br>
< h1 > Block-Level Elements < /h1 ><br>
< p > < strong > Block-level elements < /strong > always start on a new line. The
< code > & lt;h1 & gt; < /code > and < code > & lt;p & gt; < /code > elements will not sit
on the same line, whereas the inline elements flow with the rest of the
text. < /p ><br><br>
this will display output as:-<br>
<html>
<body>
<h1> Block-Level Elements </h1>
<p> <strong> Block-level elements </strong> always start on a new line. The
 elements will not sit
on the same line, whereas the inline elements flow with the rest of the
text. </p>
