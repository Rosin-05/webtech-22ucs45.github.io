<h1>Typography</h1>
While typesetting used to be the domain of skilled craftsmen, the desktop publishing revolution, which
started 25 years ago, has led us to the point where anyone can create a document on a standard PC in the
home. This was followed by the Internet revolution, which has removed the need to print many
messages because they can be seen on a screen.<br><br>
While technology has allowed anyone to create documents on a home PC, the skills and experience
of the typesetters who knew how to make type attractive and easy to read were not built into the new
technology. But we can learn a lot from the experience of these craftsmen. Studying even the basics of
typography can have a big impact on the design of your pages, and also on how many (and which)
of your precious words are read.<br><br>
Typography can be defined as the art of arranging text so that it is carefully composed on the page to
create a readable, coherent, and visually satisfying whole that works invisibly. This means putting a lot
of care and attention into typesetting in order to make your message clearer and help the reader navigate
around the page with ease, but doing so in a manner that does not call readers’ attention to what you are
trying to do.<br><br>
When you consider that web users commonly scan pages to find the information that they want, the
value of good typography becomes even more apparent.<br><br>
In this section, we will be looking at issues such as:
<ol>
<li>Line length</li>
<li>Relationship between sizes of letters</li>
<li>Gaps between lines</li>
<li>Spaces between letters and words</li>
<li>Careful chunking</li>
<li>Contrast</li>
</ol>
<h1>Choice of fonts</h1>
Before you look at these issues in detail, it is worth clarifying a couple of terms typographers use:
<ol>
<li>Legible: Text is legible if it is recognizable; for example, when a font gets too small it may no
longer be legible.</li>
<li>Readable: Text is readable if it is comfortable to read it for many minutes (without strain
or difficulty).</li>
</ol>
A legible typeface can become unreadable through poor setting and placement, and a less legible
typeface can be made more readable through good design.
<h1>Line Length — A Measure</h1>
A measure is the name typographers give to the number of characters in a single line of text.
It is generally considered that for a body of text (such as a news article), the line length should be
between 45 and 75 characters including letters, spacing, and punctuation. If you have a narrow column,
your measure should be less — around 30 to 50 characters.<br><br>
At the end of each line of text, readers have to make an effort to accurately find the beginning of the next
line, and they have to do this before the flow of the reading is lost. If a line is too long, it can be harder
for the reader to scan back to the left - hand side of the page. If there are two few characters, the reader
has to move onto the next line more often, causing too many breaks in the reading.
In a liquid layout you do not have control over the measure because users can increase and decrease the
width of the writing as they change the size of the browser window. This is a key reason why text - heavy
sites, such as news sites, often like to use fixed - width layouts.<br><br>
With a fixed layout, you have greater ability to control the measure (although if the user changes the size
of the font, it will affect the number of characters on each line). Figure 10 - 1 shows the BBC news site; as
you can see, the main column (below the picture) has a measure of 45 – 75 words, and next to the picture
and in the right - hand column the measure is less (30 – 50 characters).<br><br>
<h1>Font Sizes</h1>
You have probably come across the following series of typeface sizes in all kinds of programs, such as
Word, Photoshop, or InDesign:<br>
8pt 9pt 10pt 11pt 12pt 14pt 18pt 24pt 36pt 48pt 60pt 72pt<br><br>
Such programs use the same sizes because they are set according to a scale or ratio, which was
developed by European typographers in the sixteenth century.<br><br>
Just as the shape of a rectangle based upon the golden ratio (with the square of its hypotenuse equal to
the sum of its sides) looks pleasing to the eye, this scale of fonts works well and has changed little in the
last 400 years.<br><br>
Therefore, when you start designing pages, using these font sizes will help your pages look a lot
more balanced.<br><br>
You could choose settings in pixels that follow this scale of size, like so:<br><br>
body {font-size: 12px;}<br>
h1 {font-size: 24px;}<br>
h2 {font-size: 18px;}<br>
h3 {font-size: 16px;}<br>
h4 {font-size: 14px;}<br>
Unfortunately, specifying font sizes in pixels is not very good for accessibility because Internet Explorer
does not allow users to resize text when its size is specified in pixels. Therefore, you should aim to create
a similar effect using percentages or ems as a unit of measurement because they will allow all users to
change the size of the text.<br><br>
Fortunately, the default size of text in all browsers is 16 pixels, so we can work from this point to create
the correct size using percentages like so:<br><br>
body {font-size: 75%;} /* 16 x .075 = 12 */<br>
h1 {font-size: 200%;} /* 12 x 2 = 24 */<br>
h2 {font-size: 150%;} /* 12 x 1.5 = 18 */<br>
h3 {font-size: 133%;} /* 12 x 1.333 = 16 */<br>
h4 {font-size: 116%;} /* 12 x 1.16 = 14 */<br>
You could also use ems. Ems allow you to change the size of text relative to the size of the text element ’ s
parent element, so if the body of a web page is 16 pixels, to get a paragraph to render at 12px you use
0.75em:<br><br>
body {font-size: 100%;} /* ensure IE scales correctly */<br>
p {font-size: 0.75em;} /* 16 x 0.75 = 12 */<br>
h1 {font-size: 1.5em;} /* 16 x 1.5 = 24 */<br>
h2 {font-size: 1.3em;} /* 16 x 1.125 = 18 */<br>
h3 {font-size: 0.875em;} /* 16 x 0.875 = 14 */<br>
You may have noticed in this example that there is a rule for the < body > element and the < p > element<br><br>
</font>
</body>
