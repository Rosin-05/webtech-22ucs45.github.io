<h1>Form Controls</h1>
You ’ ve met the < form > element, so this section goes on to cover the different types of form controls that
live inside the < form > element to collect data from a visitor to your site. You will see:
<br><br>
<ol>
<li>Text input controls</li>
<li>Buttons</li>
<li>Checkboxes and radio buttons</li>
<li>Select boxes (sometimes referred to as drop - down menus and list boxes)</li>
<li>File select boxes</li>
<li>Hidden controls</li>
<br><br>
Single - Line Text Input Controls
Single - line text input controls are created using an < input > element whose type attribute has a value of
text . Here is a basic example of a single - line text input used for a search box :<br><br>
< form action=”http://www.example.com/search.aspx” method=”get”
name=”frmSearch” ><br>
Search:<br>
< input type=”text” name=”txtSearch” value=”Search for” size=”20”
maxlength=”64” / ><br>
< input type=”submit” value=”Submit” / ><br>
< /form ><br>
<h1>Radio Buttons</h1>
Radio buttons are similar to checkboxes in that they can be either on or off, but there are two
key differences:<br><br>
<ol>
<li>When you have a group of radio buttons that share the same name, only one of them can be
selected. Once one radio button has been selected, if the user clicks another option, the new
option is selected and the old one deselected.</li><br>
<li>You should not use radio buttons for a single form control where the control indicates on or off,
because once a lone radio button has been selected it cannot be deselected again (without
writing a script to do that).</li>
</ol><br><br>
Therefore, a group of radio buttons are ideal if you want to provide users with a number of options from
which they must pick only one. In such situations, an alternative is to use a drop - down select box that
allows users to select only one option from several. Your decision between whether to use a select box or
a group of radio buttons depends on three things:<br><br>
<ol>
<li>User expectations: If your form models a paper form where users would be presented with
several checkboxes, from which they can pick only one, then you should use a group of
radio buttons.</li><br>
<li>Seeing all the options: If users would benefit from having all the options in front of them before
they pick one, you should use a group of radio buttons.</li><br>
<li>Space: If you are concerned about space, a drop - down select box will take up far less space than
a set of radio buttons.</li><br>
</ol>
