<h1>Creating a Form with the < form > Element</h1>
As you have already seen, forms live inside an element called < form > . The < form > element can also
contain other markup, such as paragraphs, headings, and so on, although it may not contain another
< form > element.<br><br>
Providing you keep your < form > elements separate from each other (and no < form > element contains
another < form > element), your page may contain as many forms as you like. For example, you might
have a login form, a search form, and a form to subscribe to a newsletter, all on the same page. If you
do have more than one form on a page, users will be able to send the data from only one form at a time
to the server.<br><br>
Every < form > element should carry at least two attributes:<br><br>
action method<br>
A < form > element may also carry all of the universal attributes, the UI event attributes, and the
following attributes:<br><br>
enctype, accept, accept-charset, onsubmit, onreset.<br><br>
<h1>The method Attribute</h1>
Form data can be sent to the server in two ways, each corresponding to an HTTP method :
The get method, which sends data as part of the URL
The post method, which hides data in something known as the HTTP headers
You learn more about these two methods later in the chapter, where you will learn what they mean and
when you should use each one.
<h1>The id Attribute</h1>
The id attribute allows you to uniquely identify the < form > element within a page, just as you can use it
to uniquely identify any element on a page.
It is good practice to give every < form > element an id attribute, because many forms make use of style
sheets and scripts, which may require the use of the id attribute to identify the form.
The value of the id attribute should be unique within the document, and it should also follow the other
rules for values of the id attribute mentioned in Chapter 1. Some people start the value of id and name
attributes for forms with the characters frm and then use the rest of the value to describe the kind of data
the form collects — for example, frmLogin or frmSearch .
<h1>The name Attribute (Deprecated)</h1>
As you have already seen through its use on other elements, the name attribute is the predecessor to the
id attribute, and as with the id attribute, the value should be unique to the document.
Generally, you will not need to use this attribute, but when you do use it you can give it the same value
as the id attribute. You will often see the value of this attribute begin with the characters frm followed
by the purpose of the form (such as frmLogin or frmSearch ).
<h1>The onsubmit Attribute</h1>
At some point, you have probably filled in a form on a web site, and then, as soon as you have clicked
the button to send the form data (even before the page is sent to the server), been shown a message
telling you that you have missed entering some data, or entered the wrong data. When this happens, the
chances are you have come across a form that uses the onsubmit attribute to run a script in the browser
that checks the data you entered before the form is sent to the server.
<h1>The accept - charset Attribute</h1>
Different languages are written in different character sets or groups of characters. However, when creating
web sites, developers do not always build them to understand all different languages. The idea behind
the accept - charset attribute is that it specifies a list of character encodings that a user may enter and
that the server can then process. Values should be a space - separated or comma - delimited list of character
sets<br><br>
For example, the following indicates that a server accepts UTF - 8 encodings:
accept-charset=”utf-8”
<h1>The accept Attribute</h1>
The accept attribute is similar to the accept - charset attribute except it takes a comma - separated list
of content types (or file types) that the server processing the form can handle. Unfortunately, none of the
main browsers supports this feature.
The idea is that a user would not be able to upload a file of a different content type other than those
listed. Here, you can see that the only types intended to be uploaded are images that are GIFs or JPEGs:
accept=”image/gif, image/jpg”
Since the main browsers currently ignore this attribute, if you were to use it visitors would still be able to
upload any file.
<h1>The target Attribute</h1>
The target attribute is usually used with the < a > element to indicate which frame or browser window
the link should be loaded into. It can also be used with a form to indicate which frame or window the
form results open in when the user has submitted a form (frames are covered in the next chapter).
<h1>White Space and the < form > Element</h1>
You should also be aware that when a browser comes across a < form > element it often creates extra
white space around that element. This can particularly affect your design if you want a form to fit in
a small area, such as putting a search form in a menu bar. If CSS will not cure this problem in the
browsers you are targeting, the only way to avoid the problem is through careful placement of
the < form > element.
