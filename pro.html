<h1>CSS Properties</h1>
You now know that styling a web page using CSS involves creating rules, and that these rules contain
two parts: firstly, a selector to indicate which elements the rule applies to, and secondly, one or more
properties which control the presentation of these elements.
So, if there is a part of the page that you want to make a certain color or size, then you need to find the
corresponding property to control those elements.<br><br>
The properties are grouped together into related functionality; for example, there are properties that
allow you to control the presentation of tables, lists, and backgrounds.<br><br>
<p align="center"><image src="photo.png"></p>
<p align="center"><image src="photo2.png"></p>
<h1>Controlling Text</h1>
Several properties allow you to control the appearance of text in your documents. These can be split into
two groups:<br><br>
<ol>
<li>Those that directly affect the font and its appearance (including the typeface used, whether it is
regular, bold or italic, and the size of the text)</li>
<li>Those that would have the same effect on the text irrespective of the font used (these include
color of the text and the spacing between words or letters)</li>
</ol>
The following table lists the properties that directly affect the font (the first of these two groups):

Before looking at these properties in detail, it helps to understand some key terms used in typography.
Perhaps most importantly, a font is not the same thing as a typeface:
<ul>
A typeface is a family of fonts, such as the Arial family.</li>
<li>A font is a specific member of that family, such as Arial 12 - point bold.</li>
</ul>
<br><br>
<h1>Text Formatting</h1>
In addition to the properties that affect the font, there are several properties to affect the appearance
or formatting of your text (independently from the font it is shown in). They are listed in the table
that follows.<br><br>
