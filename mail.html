<h1>Advanced E - mail Links</h1>
As you saw at the beginning of the chapter, you can make a link open up the user ’ s default e - mail editor,
and automatically address an e - mail to you — or any other e - mail address you give. This is done like so:<br><br>
< a href=”mailto:info@example.org” > info@example.org < /a ><br><br>
You can also specify some other parts of the message, such as the subject, body, and e - mail addresses
that should be CC ’ d or BCC ’ d on the message.<br>
To control other properties of the e - mail, you place a question mark after the e - mail address and then use
name/value pairs to specify the additional properties. The name and the value are separated by an
equal sign.<br><br>
For example, to make the subject line of the e - mail Inquiry , you would add the subject property name
followed by an equals sign, and then the term Inquiry , like so:<br><br>
< a href=”mailto:info@example.org?subject=Inquiry” ><br><br>
You can specify more than one property by separating the name/value pairs with an ampersand. Here
you can see that the subject and a CC address have been added in:<br><br>
< a href=”mailto:info@example.org?subject=XHTML & cc=sales@example.org” > < /a >
</font>
