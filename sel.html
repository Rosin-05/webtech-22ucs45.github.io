<h1>Text Pseudo - Classes</h1>
While you are learning about text, there are two pseudo - classes that can help you work with text. These
pseudo - classes allow you to render either the first letter or the first line of an element in a different way
than the rest of that element.
<h1>The first - letter Pseudo - Class</h1>
The first - letter pseudo - class allows you to specify a rule just for the first letter of an element. This is
most commonly used on the first character of a new page, either in some magazine articles or in books.
Here is an example of the first - letter pseudo - class applied to a < p > element that has a class
attribute whose value is introduction . Note how the selector for the element and the first - letter
pseudo - class are separated by a colon:<br><br>
p.introduction:first-letter {font-size:42px;<br><br>
<h1>The first - line Pseudo - Class</h1>
The first - line pseudo - class should allow you to render the first line of any paragraph differently
from the rest of the paragraph. Commonly this might be in a bold font so that the reader can clearly see
an introduction (for articles) or the first line (for poems).<br><br>
The name of the pseudo - class is separated from the selector for the element by a colon:<br><br>
p.introduction:first-line {font-weight:bold;}<br><br>
<h1>Selectors</h1>
So far, you have seen lots of examples of properties that affect the presentation of text, and you have seen
how these properties are applied to elements using style rules. Before we continue to look at more
properties, we need to look at some more fundamental issues. We will start by looking at how you can
use different types of selector to specify which elements a style sheet rule will apply to before going on to
look at the different units of measurements used in CSS.<br><br>
You can specify which elements a style sheet rule applies to in several ways, not just by using the names
of the elements as you have seen so far in this chapter (which is, incidentally, known as a simple selector ),
or using the value of the class attribute or id attribute. Let ’ s take a look at the different types of selector
that are available to specify which element(s) a CSS rule applies to.<br><br>
<h1>Universal Selector</h1>
The universal selector is an asterisk; it is like a wildcard and matches all element types in the document.
<br><br>*{}
If you want a rule to apply to all elements, you can use this selector. Sometimes it is used for default
values that will apply to the whole of the document (such as a font - family and font - size ) unless
another more specific selector indicates that an element should use different values for these same
properties.
It is slightly different from applying default styles to the < body > element, as the universal selector
applies to every element and does not rely on the property being inherited from the rules that apply to
the < body > element.
<h1>The Type Selector</h1>
The type selector matches all of the elements specified in the comma - delimited list. It allows you to apply
the same rules to several elements. For example, if you wanted to apply the same rules to different sized
heading elements, the following would match all h1 , h2 , and h3 elements:<br><br>
h1, h2, h3 {}
<h1>The Class Selector</h1>
The class selector allows you to match a rule with an element (or elements) carrying a class attribute
whose value matches the one you specify in the class selector. For example, imagine you had a < p >
element with a class attribute whose value was BackgroundNote , like so:<br><br>
< p class=”BackgroundNote” > This paragraph contains an aside. < /p >
You can use a class selector in one of two ways here. One way is to simply assign a rule that applies to
any element that has a class attribute whose value is BackgroundNote , like so, preceding the value of
the class attribute with a period or full stop:<br><br>
.BackgroundNote {}
Or you can create a selector that selects only the < p > elements that carry a class attribute with a value
of BackgroundNote (not other elements) like so:<br><br>
p.BackgroundNote {}
<h1>The ID Selector</h1>
The id selector works just like a class selector, but works on the value of id attributes. Rather than using a
period or full stop before the value of the id attribute, you use a hash or pound sign ( # ). So an element
with an id attribute whose value is abstract can be identified with this selector.<br><br>
#abstract
Because the value of an id attribute should be unique within a document, this selector should apply
only to the content of one element (and you should not have to specify the element name).
<h1>The Child Selector</h1>
The child selector matches an element that is a direct child of another. In this case it matches any
< b > elements that are direct children of < td > elements. The names of the two elements are separated by a
greater - than symbol to indicate that b is a child of td ( > ) which is referred to as a combinator :
td > b {}
This would enable you to specify a different style for < b > elements that are direct children of the < td >
element compared with < b > elements that appear elsewhere in the document.
As a direct child of the < td > element, no other tags would sit between the opening < td > tag and the
< b > element. For example, the following selector does not make sense because the < b > element should
not be a direct child of a < table > element (instead, a < tr > element is more likely to be the direct child of
a < table > element):<br><br>
table > b {}
IE7 was the first version of Internet Explorer to support the child selector.
<h1>The Descendant Selector</h1>
The descendant selector matches an element type that is a descendant of another specified element (or
nested inside another specified element), not just a direct child. While the greater - than symbol is the
combinator for the child selector, for the descendent selector the combinator is the space. Take a look at
this example:<br><br>
table b {}
