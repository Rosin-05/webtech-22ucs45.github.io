<h1>Navigation</h1>
A user will usually navigate your site in one of three ways:
<ul type="square">
<li>Using a menu that you provide</li>
<li>Browsing through links provided in the middle of text and other parts of the page than
the menu</li>
<li>Searching for relevant items of information</li>
</ul>
In this section, you learn how to make it easier for users to get around your site using these three
methods.<br>
<h1>Menus</h1>
A menu is a key part of any web site that features more than one page. It doesn ’ t just allow visitors to get
where they want to go; a good menu also helps them to understand what your site is about and how it is
organized.<br><br>
As you saw in Chapter 9, a site may have more than one menu; it may have primary navigation,
secondary navigation, and even tertiary navigation.
Usually, the primary menu appears either across the top of a site from left to right, or down the left side
of the page.<br><br>
Where you have primary and secondary navigation, sometimes both will be across the top of the site, or
both down the left-hand side. Other times you might find primary navigation across the top and
secondary navigation down the left-hand side.<br><br>
The menu tends to be the main way in which users will navigate between sections of a site, and good
menu design makes a big difference in how long they will spend on your site and whether or not they
achieve what they came to achieve.<br><br>
In this section, I introduce eight guiding rules:
<ol>
<li>Menus should be concise.</li>
<li>Menus should have clear labels.</li>
<li>Menus should focus on what visitors want to achieve.</li>
<li>Menus do not need to contain every link.
<li>Menus should provide context.</li>
<li>Menus should be interactive.</li>
<li>Menus should be consistent.</li>
<li>If you use icons, add the text, too.</li>
</ol>
<h1>CSS Sprites</h1>
When creating graphical buttons, you will often want to use a second version of the image when a user
hovers over it (known as a rollover state), to make it clear when someone is hovering over an image that
can be clicked on.<br><br>
Image rollovers were initially created using JavaScript to swap one image for another when the user
hovers over it. Now, a much better technique is the use of CSS sprites . CSS sprites use one image to
represent the different states of a button. When the page loads, one part of the image is shown to the user
(the normal button style), then when the user hovers over the image, a different section of the image is
shown (the rollover style).<br><br>
Some CSS sprites take this even further and have one image that represents the different possible states
that all the buttons on your site may have. We will take a look at our own example in a moment, but first,
Figure 10 - 34 shows you examples of Google and Amazon ’ s sprites: single images that represent several
parts of their interface.<br><br>
Another advantage of using sprites is that the browser is requesting only one image from the server,
rather than many, which reduces the overhead on the web server.<br><br>
To see how this works,We will be using this image to create three separate
buttons with different states when the user hovers over them
Here is the HTML for this example ( ch10_eg13.html ):<br><br>
This does not need to be an unordered list; it could be any kind of element. The key point is that we will
be setting each element to be as big as the button we want to appear. We will then use the CSS sprite as a
background image for these elements.<br>
By positioning the background image accurately, we can ensure that it shows the right image. And when
the user hovers over a link, we change the position of the background image so that it shows the same
button ’ s rollover state.<br><br>
< ul id=”navigation” ><br>
< li > < a class=”buy” href=”/buy/” title=”Buy now” > Buy now < /a > < /li ><br>
< li > < a class=”more” href=”/more/” title=”View more” > View more < /a ><br>
< /li ><br>
< li > < a class=”login” href=”/login/” title=”Login” > Login < /a > < /li ><br>
< /ul ><br><br>
in style sheet,<br><br>

#navigation li a:hover.buy {background-position:0px -70px;}<br>
#navigation li a.more {background-position:0px -140px;}<br>
#navigation li a:hover.more {background-position:0px -210px;}<br>
#navigation li a.login {background-position:0px -280px;}<br>
#navigation li a:hover.login {background-position:0px -350px;}<br>
